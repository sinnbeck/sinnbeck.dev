I just had to do some work on some rate limits on a few routes in Laravel and I could not find any resources on how to set it up, and test it properly.

## Setting up the rate limit
Add the following code inside the `configureRateLimiting()` method in `RouteServiceProvider.php`

```php
RateLimiter::for('test', function (Request $request) {  
    return Limit::perMinute(10)->by($request->ip());  
});
```
Here we add a new rate limiter for use in routes and name it `test`. 
We set it to only allow 10 requests per minute, and track it by the clients ip address.
The route can now be added to a route (or route group) as middleware.

```php
Route::get('/test', [TestController::class, 'index'])->middleware(['throttle:test']);
```
## Testing that its active
Add a new Feature test, and add a new test
```php
public function test_rate_limit_is_active()
{
    $this->get('/test')
        ->assertOk()
        ->assertHeader('X-Ratelimit-Limit', 10)  
        ->assertHeader('X-Ratelimit-Remaining', 9);
}
```
We first check that the response is ok, and then check if the header has the rate limiter `limit` (max attempts per minute) and the `remaining` count.

Next we can check if the `remaining` goes down by 1 for each request.
```php
public function test_rate_limit_decreases_remaining()
{
    for(range(1, 10) as $i) {
        $this->get('/test')
            ->assertOk()
            ->assertHeader('X-Ratelimit-Remaining', 10 - $i);
    }
    $this->get('/test')
        ->assertStatus(429)
        ->assertHeader('Retry-After', 60);
}
```
First we make 10 requests to the page, ensuring that `remaining` is decreased properly. We then finally check that we are refused access and cannot try again for 60 seconds.

## Resetting attempts
If for some reason the rate limiter needs to reset on a proper request (for a page that uses signed URL's for instance) this can be a bit tricky to set up.

First let use add the `signed` middleware to url route to secure it
```php
Route::get('/test', [TestController::class, 'index'])->middleware(['throttle:test', 'signed']);
```
and a test
```php
public function test_signed_url_blocks()
{
    $this->get('/test')
        ->assertForbidden()
        ->assertHeader('X-Ratelimit-Remaining', 9);	
}
```
Now we just need to make sure that `remaining` attempts reset after actually getting to the route. Open the `TestController` and set it up like the following
```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\RateLimiter;

class TestController extends Controller
{
    public function index(Request $request)
    {
        RateLimiter::clear(md5('test' . $request->ip()));

        return view('test');
    }
}
```
Notice here the `RateLimiter::clear(md5('test' . $request->ip()));`. This is what will reset the rate limit when the request goes through. Laravel does this by concatenating the rate limiter name, with the limit key set with `->by()`. It then hash the string with md5.
```php
RateLimiter::for('test', function (Request $request) {  
    return Limit::perMinute(10)->by($request->ip());  
});
```
Lets test that as well

```php
public function test_ratelimit_resets()
{
    $this->get('/test')
        ->assertForbidden()
        ->assertHeader('X-Ratelimit-Remaining', 9);

    $this->withoutMiddleware(\Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\ValidateSignature::class)
        ->get('/test')
        ->assertOk()
        ->assertHeader('X-Ratelimit-Remaining', 10);
}
```
First we run a forbidden request to get the rate limiter to decrease. Next we do a secondary request where we disable the signature validation, and asserts that the `remaining` is back to 10.

## The end
Hope that was helpful to some. As you can see, rate limit in laravel is simple to interact with once you get the basics. If you find any mistakes or have ideas for improvements, please contact me on [@rsinnbeck](https://twitter.com/rsinnbeck)
