I am writing the blog post as I keep getting contacted by people who want to know how how I got Vite to work with Lando. This guide will work with both running your site with http and https.

## Set up Lando
First we add a new service to `.lando.yml` for running node
```yml
services:
  node:
    type: node:16
    scanner: false
    ports:
      - 3009:3009
    build:
      - npm install
```
Here we install node version 16, and open port 3009.

We will also add two commands for running the dev server and building assets.
```yml
tooling:
  dev:
    service: node
    cmd: npm run dev
  build:
    service: node
    cmd: npm run build
```
Rebuild your site with `lando rebuild -y` and the new service is ready.

## Configure vite
Open the `vite.config.js` file that came with Laravel and add this server config
```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import laravel from 'laravel-vite-plugin';

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel({
            input: ['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'],
            refresh: true,
        }),
    ],
    server: { // [tl! focus:start]
        https: false,
        host: true,
        port: 3009,
        hmr: {host: 'localhost', protocol: 'ws'},
    }, // [tl! focus:end]
});
```
The trick is where that we set it to run on http + ws. Normally this wouldnt work with a https site, but as we also set the dev server to be accessed on `localhost`, the browser will allow it anyways!

## That's it!
Start the Vite server with `lando dev` and open your site like your normally do. Hot reloading should now be working!
