If you know a little about the service container, you also may know that you can explicitly bind things in the container as a singleton. What you might not know, is that they all actually are singletons.

Before we begin, let's quickly go through how the service container works.

NB: *All code examples uses PHP 8 syntax*

## How the service container works

In laravel you often inject classes in controllers like this

```php
public function show(MyAwesomeClass $awesome): View
{
}
```

For this to work laravel needs to know how to resolve the class `MyAwesomeClass`. If the `MyAwesomeClass` constructor does not take any parameters or they are all resolvable using the container then laravel will just magically `new` up a class instance. For the sake of argument let's say that our class constructor requires a parameter to create a new instance of the class.

```php
<?php
namespace App\Foobar;

class MyAwesomeClass 
{
    public $name;

    public function __construct(string $name): void
    {
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    public function setName(string $name): self
    {
        $this->name = $name;
        return $this;
    }
}
```

We would then need to set this up in the container. This can be done as follows in a service provider.

```php
$this->app->bind(MyAwesomeClass::class, function ($app) {
    return new MyAwesomeClass('foo');
});
```

Here we tell the service container that it should new up an instance of the class with the parameter `$name = 'foo'` if it is requested from the container.

The service container will always make a new instance of the class each time we call it. This might not always be what we want. In some cases it might make more sense to always get the same exact instance. Examples of this can be the `Request` or `Session` class, as we want to be able to change these in one part of our app, and have the change reflected elsewhere (like changing the request in a middleware). We can easily change our binding from before so that it always returns the same `MyAwesomeClass` instance

```php
$this->app->singleton(MyAwesomeClass::class, function ($app) {
    return new MyAwesomeClass(['foo' => 'bar']);
});
```

A quick recap.
With the first example we will get a new class instance of the `MyAwesomeClass` each time.

```php
$class1 = app(MyAwesomeClass::class);
$class1->setName('Foobar');
$class2 = app(MyAwesomeClass::class);

echo $class1->name; //shows Foobar
echo $class2->name; //shows foo
```

And with the singleton we get the same class instance each time

```php
$class1 = app(MyAwesomeClass::class);
$class1->setName('Foobar')
$class2 = app(MyAwesomeClass::class);

echo $class1->name; //shows Foobar
echo $class2->name; //shows Foobar
```

## How facades work

So now that you understand the basics of how the service container works, let's see how a Facade works.
A facade has just one method: `getFacadeAccessor()`

```php
<?php
namespace App\Facades;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Facade;

class MyAwesomeClassFacade extends Facade
{
    /**
     * Get the registered name of the component.
     *
     * @return string
     */
    protected static function getFacadeAccessor() {
        return \App\Foobar\MyAwesomeClass::class; 
    }
}
```

Here we tell the facade that it is uses the `MyAwesomeClass` from before. That means that when we use the facade, it knows that it should return a `MyAwesomeClass` instance.

```php
$myclass = MyAwesomeClassFacade::setName('foobar');
```

This will make a new instance of `MyAwesomeClass` and then automatically run the `setName()`method. This is done using the `__callStatic()`method in the base `Facade` class.

```php
public static function __callStatic($method, $args)
{
    $instance = static::getFacadeRoot();

    if (! $instance) {
        throw new RuntimeException('A facade root has not been set.');
    }

    return $instance->$method(...$args);
}
```

The `getFacadeRoot()` method calls the `resolveFacadeInstance()` method that is in charge of getting the correct class instance from the container.

## Why facades return the same class instance again and again (singleton)

I hope you now have a basic understanding of how classes are resolved in laravel. No let's see why facades are indeed singletons.
As I said earlier, the `resolveFacadeInstance()` method is responsible for getting the correct class from the service container. Let's now have a look at what it does.

```php
protected static function resolveFacadeInstance($name)
{
    if (is_object($name)) {
        return $name;
    }

    if (isset(static::$resolvedInstance[$name])) {
        return static::$resolvedInstance[$name];
    }

    if (static::$app) {
        return static::$resolvedInstance[$name] = static::$app[$name];
    }
}
```

Let's break it down further, and we will start at the end.

```php
protected static function resolveFacadeInstance($name)
{
    if (is_object($name)) {
        return $name;
    }

    if (isset(static::$resolvedInstance[$name])) {
        return static::$resolvedInstance[$name];
    }

    if (static::$app) { // [tl! focus]
        return static::$resolvedInstance[$name] = static::$app[$name]; // [tl! focus]
    } // [tl! focus]
} 
```

The very last part of this code is what actually gets the instance back from the container. `static::$app[$name]`. 

`$app` is the container and the `$name` is the facade accessor from earlier. Now comes the _singleton_ part when Laravel adds the returned value to a static array called `$resolvedInstance`, and if we look at the code before this, we will see that Laravel checks if the instance is already present in that array.

```php
protected static function resolveFacadeInstance($name)
{
    if (is_object($name)) {
        return $name;
    }

    if (isset(static::$resolvedInstance[$name])) { // [tl! focus]
        return static::$resolvedInstance[$name]; // [tl! focus]
    } // [tl! focus]

    if (static::$app) {
        return static::$resolvedInstance[$name] = static::$app[$name];
    }
}
```

Since this array is static, it will remember it's content throughout the entire request. That means that if we have resolved a facade once, then the next time we resolve it we get the same instance! ðŸ¤¯

## How to work around this!

Laravel itself is actually quite good at working around this. Let's take the example of the Http client.
If we did this...

```php
$response1 = Http::withHeaders([
    'X-First' => 'foo',
    'X-Second' => 'bar'
])->post('http://example.com/users', [
    'name' => 'Taylor',
]);

$response2 = Http::get('http://example2.com/users');
```

...it would be easy to assume that we would be using the same Http client instance, and yes, in fact we are! However laravel does a clever trick here with the methods.  These `withheaders()`, `post()`, `get()`, etc. don't actually exist on the underlying class. The class that the `Http` facade refers to is a `Factory` class which has the following method instead.

```php
public function __call($method, $parameters)
{
    if (static::hasMacro($method)) {
        return $this->macroCall($method, $parameters);
    }

    return tap($this->newPendingRequest(), function ($request) { //[tl! highlight:2]
        $request->stub($this->stubCallbacks);
    })->{$method}(...$parameters);
}
```

So when you call a method that does not exist like `get()` it will first check if there is a macro with that name. If not it will create a new `PendingRequest` class instance, and return that.

```php
protected function newPendingRequest()
{
    return new PendingRequest($this);
}
```

### An easier fix

If you need to ensure that you always get a new instance when using the facade, you can do this little trick (inspired by Spatie) on the class you are resolving by adding this.

```php
public function new()
{
    return new static();
}
```


You can then use the facade like this, to always get a new instance

```php
$myclass = MyAwesomeClassFacade::new();
$myclass->setName('foobar');
```

This will call the `new()` method which will ensure that you get a new instance.

***Note:***
Spatie has taken the facade completely out of the equation, and simply allow using the class itself as if it was a facade.

```php
public static function new()
{
    return new static();
}
```
Notice the static keyword. That means we can run it one the class directly.
```php
$myclass = MyAwesomeClass::new();
$myclass->setName('foobar');
```

## Wrapping up

I hope this was helpful and that you learned something new.
